# 🧠 FocusIn - Chrome Extension for Productivity

**GDSC Hackathon Project**

FocusIn is a lightweight and intuitive Google Chrome extension designed to help users stay focused and reduce distractions by blocking time-wasting websites. Whether you're studying, working, or just trying to build better habits, FocusIn empowers you to take control of your browsing time.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Toggle website blocking with a single button
- 🧱 Customizable list of blocked websites
- 🔒 Persistent settings using Chrome local storage
- 🧘‍♂️ Clean, minimalist design to keep you focused
- 🌙 Dark theme for low-distraction interface

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Users add distracting sites to the blocklist.
2. When enabled, any attempt to visit a blocked site is redirected or blocked.
3. A subtle timer records and logs attempts to visit blocked content.
4. Toggle the extension on or off using a color-coded button (green = active, red = off).
