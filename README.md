## 🛠️ How It Works

1. Users add distracting sites to the blocklist.
2. When enabled, any attempt to visit a blocked site is redirected or blocked.
3. A subtle timer records and logs attempts to visit blocked content.
4. Toggle the extension on or off using a color-coded button (green = active, red = off).
